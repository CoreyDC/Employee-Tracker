## Description

My motivation for building this project was to create an application that makes it easy to access and keep track of employees within a company. With this app an employer is able to organize their employees within a database. The database i used was sql, and building this application really taught me how to use commands in sql and how to build the database and tables within the database.

## Installation

To install this application you will need to download virtual studio code or another code editor, setup your ssh keys, and copy the git repo into your local machine. 

## Usage

After you copy the repo into your machine, you will want to make sure you have node.js, and mysql is downloaded and installed as well. After that you open your integrated terminal in your code editor run npm i to install all packages, then npm run start to start the application. Below is a video example:
